        Basic debug procedure
        　1. Update Fooocus - sometimes things just need to be updated
        　2. Backup and remove your config.txt - check if the issue is caused by bad configuration
        　3. Try a fresh installation of Fooocus in a different directory - see if a clean installation solves the issue
